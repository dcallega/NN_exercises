# NN_exercises
This repo is meant to keep track of simple exercises that are useful to understand how NNs work.


tf_small_net.py - Shows how to train a 3 layers binary classifier on 9 features using TensorFlow and basic trainig techniques.
    Also contains a basic implementation of callbacks in Keras to save checkpoints and logs for TensorBoard.
    Make your model more expressive (powerful) adding layers and increasing hidden units.
    Remember that for great models you'll need great training time and number of epochs.
